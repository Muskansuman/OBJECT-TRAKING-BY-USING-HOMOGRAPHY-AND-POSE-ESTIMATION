# OBJECT-TRAKING-BY-USING-HOMOGRAPHY-AND-POSE-ESTIMATION
This project tackles object tracking challenges with homography techniques. Capturing the object's image and using these methods, we manage variations in perspective, scale, and occlusion. Accurate pose estimation and camera calibration ensure robust tracking, vital for computer vision and autonomous systems. First, we have to run the camera calibration code to get the interensic matrix of camera which is used in pose detection code. This code also need 7 chessbord images capture by camera for which we have to find camera matrix. Now we can run object detection code. For pose detection code we have to upload video captured by camera in AVI format.
