# OBJECT-TRAKING-BY-USING-HOMOGRAPHY-AND-POSE-ESTIMATION
This project tackles object tracking challenges with homography techniques. Capturing the object's image and using these methods, we manage variations in perspective, scale, and occlusion. Accurate pose estimation and camera calibration ensure robust tracking, vital for computer vision and autonomous systems.
